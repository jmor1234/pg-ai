    <core-perspective> Main Section: Core Perspective <software-opportunity> Sub-section: The Unique Opportunity Software Presents
Getting rich in the software and tech industry is a realistic possibility, which is what makes the opportunities it offers so amazing. Naval Ravikant's perspective on leverage has significantly shaped my view on this. He discusses multiple forms of traditional leverage, including capital (money) and people (employees). However, the internet's scale has enabled new forms of leverage: media and code. These allow you to invest your time, skill, and creativity into building something that can be distributed to the masses via the internet at an incremental cost. In contrast, distributing more of a physical product to the masses requires significantly more time and money. The issue with traditional forms of leverage, such as capital, is that you need pre-existing access to large amounts of money. Hiring employees is also costly and time-consuming. While media can provide monetization opportunities through audience growth, software is the only domain where the product itself can be the business you build and monetize directly. The software you write on your own time and computer, using skills you've learned yourself, can become a business with minimal replication costs for thousands or millions of users. This is the special, unique leverage and opportunity that software provides in this new era of the internet. </software-opportunity>
<circumstances-needed> Sub-section: The Circumstances Needed to Become a Rich Software Engineer or Entrepreneur
If you meet the realistic minimum requirements to get rich in software, there's no reason not to pursue it. However, only a rare subset of people meets these requirements, and even among them, there's a limited time window to realistically go for it. The minimum requirements, or life circumstances, that enable you to capitalize on the opportunity of getting rich in the software industry are as follows:
Basic computer literacy: While you don't need to know how to code or write good software yet, you need to be comfortable enough with basic computer tasks to grasp the fundamentals of code and software development.
Time for focused effort: The most important aspect after basic computer literacy is having life circumstances that allow you to dedicate the necessary focused time and effort to learn to code. It takes many months of focused learning to develop a foundational understanding capable of building real, modern software. The more time you can allocate to this, the better your chances of becoming a rich software engineer or entrepreneur.
Common obstacles that prevent someone from having the time needed to learn to code include having a full-time non-coding job that doesn't provide opportunities to learn software skills, personal/family responsibilities (such as having children), and the need to make a certain amount of money in the short term. When learning software, you likely won't make any money for the first few months or even years, so you're investing time and effort for a long-term return.
In summary, the minimum requirements or circumstances necessary to become a rich software engineer or entrepreneur are:
Basic computer literacy
Having the time to put in the focused effort to learn
Willingness to sacrifice short-term income for long-term skill-building
Typically, this means a younger person (usually under 30) with basic computer skills, without a day job that prevents them from learning to code at work, and without significant expenses like children. </circumstances-needed>
<ai-opportunity> Sub-section: The Unique Software Opportunity Presented by the New LLM Wave
The modern software engineering landscape has fundamentally changed with the rise of large language models (LLMs) going mainstream and being integrated into every tool and new software application. LLMs save software engineers significant time and increase their learning and building efficiency by providing access to intelligence that deeply understands how to help them improve their coding and learning processes.
It has never been a better opportunity to learn to code for the first time or to be an established coder. Established software engineers now need to learn many new things because the industry has fundamentally changed and continues to evolve rapidly. When building AI-native applications, developers must consider various new aspects, such as model trade-offs and integrations, prompt engineering, embeddings, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), UI integration, and more. This presents a unique opportunity for new software engineers, as they can learn and build software more efficiently by properly using LLMs. Moreover, it levels the playing field because even established engineers have to learn these new aspects from scratch.
The industry is changing so quickly, with models dramatically improving every six months and significant money and talent being invested in this field. The new core skill set for a software engineer and entrepreneur is the ability to stay informed and learn and implement new advancements as they happen. This further levels the playing field for new engineers. </ai-opportunity>
<monetization-opportunity> Sub-section: The Monetization Opportunity
The great part about software is that it has so much leverage that the software one writes can itself be a product that can be monetized into a business. The only things standing in the way of this are skillset and capitalizing on market opportunities.
If you invest the time and effort to learn the modern AI software engineer skill set and start creating your own software, you can showcase it on platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn, which are the best places to find users and employers. If your product is good enough and provides value to the market, you can have your own software business. Even if you can't yet monetize your software as a business, simply putting your skillset out there publicly allows employers from top software and AI companies to see your abilities. The software you build serves as your resume and demonstrates your skillset. Many modern, progressive companies prioritize actual skills over degrees or certifications. The inherent nature of software engineering is that the "proof is in the pudding." You can get hired to work at one of the best software or AI companies in the world, with salaries typically ranging from $250,000 to $500,000, and many offer stock options as well. Many of these companies also offer flexible working arrangements, sometimes even mostly remote work, eliminating the need to be in a specific office or location.
You can monetize your skills by creating your own software business or by working for a great company that pays well and offers excellent flexibility. </monetization-opportunity>
<conclusion-recap> Sub-section: Conclusion and Simplified Recap
Software offers a unique opportunity that no other industry can match due to the leverage it enables. One can harness this leverage by meeting the minimum requirements in their life circumstances to learn the necessary software skills. With the fundamental shift of LLMs going mainstream in the industry, it has never been a better time to learn and build software, as it evens the playing field for new engineers. Once you have the software skillset, the nature of software itself allows you to showcase your work to the public, attracting the attention of users and employers. This enables you to either monetize your own software product as a business or gain the attention of employers who can recognize your skills through the software you've built. </conclusion-recap>
